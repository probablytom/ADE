An "Artifact Data Engine". Intended to eventually flesh out as code to dynamically create and manage schemaless data structures.

While the current implementation doesn't do much, it DOES work. Theoretically, there is very little one couldn't create using a sophisticated enough engine to interface to it all, but nobody wants to write anything that complicated and the Governer should be doing more of the work.

Still under development.

TODO
====

* Flesh out the Governer
* Provide a more meaningful implementation of an engine than BasicEngine
  * Maybe attempt a brute-force of Travelling Salesman? It's a complex problem but it would give the code lots to do and it's easy to write...
